# Testing

myGPT uses **pytest** with explicit markers to separate fast unit tests from slower integration tests.

## Test categories

### Unit tests (`@pytest.mark.unit`)

- Fast, deterministic tests
- No external dependencies
- No network access
- Use mocks, monkeypatching, and temporary files
- Live under `tests/unit/`

### Integration tests (`@pytest.mark.integration`)

- Require running services:
  - Ollama
  - Cassandra (Docker)
  - FastAPI backend
- Exercise real HTTP and database interactions
- Live under `tests/integration/`

## Running tests

Run **all tests** (default):

```bash
pytest
```

Run **unit tests only**:

```bash
pytest -m unit
```

Run **integration tests only**:

```bash
pytest -m integration
```

## Test logs

All test runs (unit and integration) write logs to:

```text
~/.myGPT/logs/tests.log
```

The log file is **truncated at the start of each pytest run**, so it always reflects the most recent execution.

This logging setup mirrors the application and CLI logging configuration to ensure consistency when debugging test failures.

## Writing new tests

- Add new unit tests under `tests/unit/` and mark them with `@pytest.mark.unit` (or use a file-level marker).
- Add new integration tests under `tests/integration/` and mark them with `@pytest.mark.integration`.
- Do not mix unit and integration behavior in the same test file.

## Notes

- Integration tests will be skipped automatically if required services are not reachable.
- Use `pytest -v` for verbose output during development.
