# Review Runbook (review-agent)

## 0) Preconditions
- PR targets active release branch.
- CI is green (required to merge unless human exception).
- PR body includes `Closes #ISSUE` linking to a valid issue.

### Project hygiene
Every assignee is responsible for verifying project hygiene before reassigning:
- PRs must be linked to issues via `Closes #ISSUE` in PR body
- Issues must have all required project fields populated
- Merged PRs without linked issues must be corrected
- Project fields must be accurate before state transitions

### Review Trigger (review-agent ownership)
The review workflow is triggered when review-agent is assigned as reviewer:
- **Automatic**: When `developer_submit_for_review.sh` assigns review-agent as reviewer
- **Manual re-trigger options**:
  - Push new commit to PR branch (triggers on synchronize)
  - Comment `@review` on the PR
  - Run via GitHub Actions UI: `gh workflow run claude-code-review.yml -f pr_number=<N>`

The review-agent OWNS the review process:
- Review workflow uses `REVIEW_AGENT_TOKEN` for all GitHub operations
- Review comments are posted by review-agent (claude[bot])
- Review-agent orchestrates the auto-fix loop (developer-agent executes fixes)

## 1) Review checklist

**IMPORTANT:**
- Run CI checks on ALL code in the repository (not just changed files)
- Review ALL changed files in the PR (not just new changes from current cycle)
- This ensures comprehensive quality coverage across the entire codebase

### Core Requirements (from project standards)
- Correctness vs issue acceptance criteria
- Tests added/updated and meaningful
- No architecture boundary violations
- No secrets committed
- Clear docs updates for user-facing changes
- Reasonable maintainability

### Additional Quality Checks (comprehensive review)
- Code quality and best practices (use CLAUDE.md for guidance)
- Performance considerations and potential bottlenecks
- Security concerns beyond secret detection
- Potential bugs or edge cases not covered by tests
- API contract consistency and backward compatibility

## 2) Severity model
- Critical: correctness/security/data-loss/performance regression; must block merge
- Medium: significant bug risk, missing tests, broken contract, poor maintainability; must block merge
- Minor: style/nits, minor optimization opportunities; may proceed

## 3) CI failure handling
If CI fails during review (should not happen if developer phase worked correctly):
- Still review the code changes
- Capture all issues (CI failures + code review findings)
- Proceed with normal REQUEST_CHANGES flow
- Set issue status -> In Progress
- Assign issue -> developer-agent
- Comment with all findings (CI + code issues)

Note: Pre-commit hooks should prevent CI failures. If they occur, treat as REQUEST_CHANGES.

## 4) Review and recommendation
After completing the review:
- Post a structured review comment starting with "## Code Review - [APPROVE|REQUEST_CHANGES]"
- Include findings organized by severity (Critical/Medium/Minor)
- Provide clear recommendation with rationale

## 5) Automatic execution
The review decision is automatically executed based on the review comment:
- **APPROVE**: Workflow automatically merges the PR (no human confirmation required)
- **REQUEST_CHANGES**:
  - Issue returns to developer-agent with "In Progress" status
  - Developer reads review comment and implements fixes
  - Developer runs tests in 3-try loop (resets each assignment) BEFORE committing
  - Developer commits and re-submits for review (triggers re-review automatically)
  - Review cycle repeats (cumulative count tracked)
  - After 3 review cycles: Issue stays "In Review", escalates to human owner

Manual override (optional):
- `@approve-merge` - Human can manually trigger merge
- `@request-changes` - Human can manually trigger changes workflow (legacy)

## 6) Review cycle escalation
The review workflow tracks cumulative review cycles:
- Each REQUEST_CHANGES increments the cycle counter
- Developer 3-try loop (for test failures) resets each time issue is reassigned
- Review 3-cycle limit is cumulative across all reviews for this PR
- After 3rd REQUEST_CHANGES review:
  - Issue remains Status -> In Review
  - Issue reassigned to HUMAN_OWNER
  - Slack DM sent to human
  - Human intervenes to resolve

All fixes happen on the PR branch (no separate issues created).

## 7) Merge criteria
- All tests and linters passing
- Code review APPROVE decision (either from review agent or human override)

## 8) Post-merge
When PR is merged (automatically on APPROVE or via human `@approve-merge` override):
- Automation merges into active release branch (NEVER merge to master/main)
- Delete short-lived feature/fix branches created for the feature
- Close the issue (GitHub state)
- Keep issue status -> In Review (for human stakeholder acceptance)
- Assign issue -> human owner (dkblinux98)
- Notify scrummaster-agent that developer-agent is ready for next issue

### Important: Issue auto-close behavior
- PRs merged to the release branch (e.g., v1.0.0) do NOT auto-close linked issues
- GitHub only auto-closes issues when PRs merge to the default branch (master)
- Automation manually closes issues after merging to release branch
- Post-merge: issue should be CLOSED (GitHub state) + In Review (project status) + assigned to human

## 9) Phase completion
When the human owner moves the last issue in the active Phase to "For Release" (human stakeholder acceptance):
- Notify human owner that phase is complete and ready for release

## 10) Configuration

### Required Secrets
The review workflow requires these secrets to be configured:
- `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` - OAuth token for Claude Code agent
- `REVIEW_AGENT_TOKEN` - GitHub token with repo/project permissions (used for review workflow)

**How to configure secrets:**
- Navigate to: Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Secrets
- Click "New repository secret"
- Add all secrets if not already present

### Branch Cleanup
Branch deletion happens in `review_accept_and_merge.sh` via `--delete-branch`, not in auto-fix workflow.
